/*************************  RACE MODE *************************************
 * in this mode you can't shoot anymore. A and B do the same as up and down.
 * you have to pass the 9 checkpoints in the right order (a compas will show 
 * you the direction of the next one).
 * 
 * Try to beat my personal best :
 * 
 *  *  on the Emulator :
 * 'O' normal  :  2892
 * 'O' fast    :  2388
 * 'Z' normal  :  2882
 * 'Z' fast    :  2782
 * 'X' normal  :  3272
 * 'X' fast    :  2394
 * 
 *  *  on the Arduboy :
 * 'O' normal  :  3504
 * 'O' fast    :  2648
 * 'Z' normal  :  4144
 * 'Z' fast    :  3257
 * 'X' normal  :  3979
 * 'X' fast    :  2908
 * 
 * Don't forget: opposing accelerating is faster than the brake. Both are even faster
