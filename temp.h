/*************************  RACE MODE *************************************
 * in this mode you can't shoot anymore. A and B do the same as up and down.
 * you have to pass the 9 checkpoints in the right order (a compas will show 
 * you the direction of the next one).
 * 
 * Try to beat my personal best :
 * 
 *  *  on an Emulator :
 * 'O' normal  :
 * 'O' fast    :
 * 'Z' normal  :
 * 'Z' fast    :
 * 'X' normal  :
 * 'X' fast    :
 * 
 *  *  on the Arduboy :
 * 'O' normal  :
 * 'O' fast    :
 * 'Z' normal  :
 * 'Z' fast    :
 * 'X' normal  :
 * 'X' fast    :
 * 
 * Don't forget: opposing accelerating is faster than the brake. Both are even faster
